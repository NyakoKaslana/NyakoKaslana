Hello, fellows.

I'm *Nyako Kaslana*, you can call me *Liliya Mikhailovna Adnreyeva* also.

I'm working on the projects of AP Computer Science Principle and prepared for the AP Computer Science A in next semester. My working field is Java and Python (sometimes HOI4 Mods but the gfx are too hard for me)
